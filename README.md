**Animatrix and GraphicsExpanded** are mods for the famous game *Minecraft* from Mojang. This mod allows the use of Skeleton based rendering and animations for Entities.
It allows modder to use custom and beautiful animations and models created outside of the usual Minecraft programming paradigms, like with for example Blender, and export those models and Animations to Collada, for use inside the Minecraft game engine.
This is a 1.7.10 port of Animatrix, GraphicsExpanded (which Animatrix depends on) and the animatrix example mod, which also happens to fix a few bugs.
